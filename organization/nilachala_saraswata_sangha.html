		    <p>Nilachal Saraswata Sangha (NSS), Puri, was founded by Swami Nigamananda Paramahans Dev exclusively for his household devotees in Orissa on 24th August 1934, on his birthday, at Nilachal Kutir, his eternal abode at Puri, India. </p>
			<p>The principal value of Nilachal Saraswat Sangha was clearly delineated by Sri Gurudev himself that it must not focus on publicity for the spread of his teachings; which should, rather, be aptly reflected through examples set by everyday lives of his followers. If established in true human values; a single such person can achieve the impossible. Those who desire to dedicate their life for welfare of others and yet wouldn't be nurturing recognition in exchange, only such silent workers need to be in the Sangha.</p>
			<h2>The four pronged practices defined for sangha-sevis are </h2>
			<ul>
			<li>Establishment of the power of Sangha</li>
			<li>Atmagathan </li>
			<li>Foundation of ideal family life</li>
			<li>Carrying out activities benefiting the larger human society</li>
			</ul>
			<p>NSS was started with a few devotees who were then school students but ardent followers of the Paramahans Dev. The bee line of devotees gradually emerged from the nook and corners of Orissa state coinciding with the publication of the biography of Swami Nigamananda in Oriya in the year 1942.</p>
			<p>The first Secretary of the Sangha was Shri Banamali Dash, an eminent lawyer, social worker and a dignitary of Puri, a disciple of Swami Nigamananda who subsequently became its President and Shri Durga Charan Mohanty as Secretary. Subsequently, Sri Durga Charan Mohanty became its Secretary and Palichalaka or Administer. As of 2010, Sri Syam Sunder Dash is the President of Nilachala Saraswata Sangha and Sri Sangram Kesari Sinha is the Vice-President and the Parichalaka or the Administer.</p>
			<p>NSS is a registered body under the Indian Societies Registration Act. It has a registered Bye-law containing details of its organizational structure and positions created for its effective management. Its registered headquarter is at Shri Shri Nigamananda Smruti Mandir, Swargadwara, Puri, Odisha, India whereas its working office is at <br/>
			<b>Satsikshya Mandir, <br/>A/4, Unit-9, Bhubaneswar-751022,<br/>Odisha, India.</b></p>
			<p>NSS issues annual identity cards to its members containing the text of daily prayers before the Guru and some do's and don’ts. NSS believes in the eternal existence of Shri Shri Guru Maharaj, Swami Nigamananda Saraswati Dev. Each member of NSS accepts Swami Nigamananda as their only Guru and gives affirmation to NSS that is or she will be fully guided by the directions of the NSS. As per the Bye-law of NSS, only household devotees of Swami Nigamananda will be its members.</p>
			<p>NSS guides their member-devotees on the path of their spiritual progress and in attainment of 'Chitta Sudhi' and facilitates in the fulfillment of the mission of Swami Nigamananda by propagating Sanatan Dharma (the Eternal Religion), spreading 'Satsikshya' (education leading to spiritual advancement) and Siva Jnane Jiva Seva (serving the living beings deeming it as service rendered to The Supreme Being) in various ways.
