'My dear sons! There is a soft light before me.  I see many wide paths in this light. Therefore, I and those who are my  own, cannot remain idle any longer. There are many tasks to be performed. Each member of our brotherhood led by the arm or borne on the shoulder has to be placed on the Mother’s lap. When desire is destroyed, bliss prevails. The establishment of a Heavenly Kingdom after the great  war is an inevitable law of nature. The duties of the Great Guru have greatly increased. There is no time for regret and remorse. Only chant the Mother’s name like her true sons.',
'You are the children of the Supreme Spirit, the Divine Mother. You were sunk in a slumber of desire so long. Since, by the Guru’s grace, you have realized your true selves, Why do you wait any longer? Shake off any kinds of sloth, all kinds of weaknesses, and arise. Chant the Mother’s name and wake up Her sons. Chant the Mother’s name and declare Her advent in Bengal. Let Her name echo from horizon to horizon.',
'The problems of the world are becoming  more and more acute everyday. Common person’s misery is boundless. But the soothing breeze of approaching good days has also started blowing. Everything will be fine in the days to come. There are indications that everything will be free from trouble. Soon God’s blessings and grace will be manifested. Then the food problem of the ordinary man will also be solved. Those who will survive these evil days, those who will get food and clothes will be happy and exalted to see the state of the nation when the new sun arises. And there is nothing to say about those who, by the Guru’s grace and by virtue of purification of their souls will directly experience the advent of God! Then nobody will care for such trifling things as food and clothes.',
'My Sons! You are children of Hindus. Can you show from the scriptures anyone who sought shelter at the feet of religion and yet was happy in this world? Rather, it is the religious-minded, who have been crushed by suffering and misery at every step. The Pandavas and Draupadi were under Lord Krishna’s protection and yet what tremendous  suffering they had to endure! Don’t you all know this? Then what is the use of complaining to me that I have bestowed sufferings on you? I am not your enemy. You are not merely my disciples. I love you like my own children and hold you dearer than my own life. If I really had the power to remove your sorrows, could I sit idle and witness the suffering of children? I am at loss wondering how to bring you out of the curse of sins of your past lives (birth) and elevate you in the sacred path of sacrifice. On top of that I have to bear your tortures. Nevertheless, whatever you do, whichever path you follow I shall always wish your well-being and shed tears for you before the Universal Mother. What else can I do?',
'Sons! Don’t  feel disappointed. Feel strong. Don’t think yourselves low or week. Always think that you are sons of the Mother. You cannot be base in any way. Particularly, those who have obtained the Guru’s grace have nothing to worry. The Mother will certainly come and take you up in her lap. Can the devoted wife neglect her husband’s most beloved sons?',
'Dear! It seems I have forgotten God for you. Can I forget you? You are the swallows of my heart’s bower. Haven’t I pored out my heart into your morning songs? I am only counting the number of vibrations each of your cooing creates in my heart’s reed. Every moment I think of you and this absorbs me into a world of contemplation. All my heart’s attention is on you only.',
'Sons! I have, on my own, taken up the responsibility of your spiritual life. If you have a little faith in me, why should you worry? Even if you don’t do any spiritual work and spend your days in fun and frolic, I shall wish your well-being. You too will reach the state I have reached. So what’s there to worry? You will get everything when time comes.',
'Build up a world of love. Keep me at the centre and work in my family.  Always remember that every work you perform is meant for Thakur. All houses and buildings belong to Thakur. This is Thakur’s world and you are working for him. Every time you breathe out, the breathe must be directed towards Thakur. There  is nothing  to worry. Dispel Maya and bring love in its place. Maya is prohibited in Thakur’s world. ',
'My disciples are like my sons. You can commit hundreds of mistakes but can I be angry with you for that? I shall always forgive hundreds of your mistakes and bless you with all my heart. ',
'Spiritual progress depends on the grace of God, that is, on the grace of Guru. Penances, prayers, offerings and rituals are mere pretexts. Yes, these are essential to attract  the grace . Once I have accepted you as my disciples, you will never be deprived of that grace even if you are not qualified for it. But it is a matter of time and you will realise it when time comes.',
'The hour of grace is also fixed. As long as the ‘gunas’ are present, wisdom does not reveal itself . In whatever condition you may be, never forget to concentrate your thoughts on me. Practice obedience or dependence. Do not feel disappointed . When you will not be able to surrender wholly to me. When you will lose prode in your egoistic self, you  will be able to feel yourself poor. Then, ofcourse, the friend of the poor will turn up. Service to the Sadguru will not be in vain.',
'Sons ! When I have accepted you as my disciples, whenever I am , I shall always wish your well-being and shall bestow love and blessing upon you. And you are not merely my disciples. Do not forget that I love you as I would love my own sons and daughters.',
'Sons ! Once I have accepted someone as my disciple, can I abandon him ? You are not my disciple in this life only. Our relationship was established since your first birth. Birth after birth you have neglected your own salvation and accompanied me to serve and help me.  You will learn everything when time comes.',
'If by the Mother’s grace you attain true knowledge, your mind will be at harmony in joy, in misery, in illness, in sorrow, in danger, in prosperity, in every situation. Ignorance and pride bring disquiet and anxiety. The ascetic is happy though he embraces al sorrow voluntarily. In spite of being house-holders you will find the happiness of the ascetic by the grace of the Mother.',
'Sons ! You should expect love from only those who are your own. And how long do you need to wait? When this worldly sport ends you will proceed to the eternal abode and meet your immortal kinsmen. Wait for the day, and chanting the Mother’s name loudly drive away all sensual attractions and attachment to worldly things.',
'Human life is only one of the layers. Life is arranged in layers just as we have layers of soil in the earth. Therefore, the activities will be in accordance with the layer that becomes manifest. Why should that perturb you ? Ignore worldly joys and sorrow and move towards the source of everlasting joy.',
'Sons ! Sing hymns in praise of the Mother without any fear. Time will heal everything. Do not be perturbed by the wounds and sufferings of this world.  Hold fast to the peg that upholds the world and invoke the Mother. She will come running and take you up in her lap. ',
'I am your Guru; you have accepted me as your Guru. So I shall let you know what you need in order to advance yourselves in spiritual life.  It is not wise to do anything in imitation of others. The Mother’s grace alone can lead you to shelter at Her feet. Ceremonies are outward shows. Sons ! Do not abandon  the substance for the shadow. The task I have entrusted you with is enough. Pray with all your heart and you will not need to do anything more.',
'The true remuneration or reward for the Guru is the disciples’ total devotion. If you can offer yourself completely at the Guru’s feet, it is reward enough for him. The Guru also desires the disciples’ total devition. So, offer yourselves fully at the Guru’s feet. It will be reward enough for him and you will also get the fruit of your offering.',
'Why do you need to worry? You have heard the True Message from me. Take shelter in truth, depend on Truth and let Truth be the consummation of your life.',
'You are children of the Divine Spirit. Do not remain ever enraptured by the temptations of this mortal world. Wake, arise and march ahead. Do not look backward. I do not want to see my children enraptured in sorrows and desires.',
'How ever small and stupid he may be, after all he is my child. So what is there to repent ?',
'Sons ! Are you Shaktas ? Why do you accept this path ? I know you are Vaishnavas. You can not attain the Primordial Spirit through the Eight accomplishments following my method of sadhana. You will attain Love and Devotion. The day the Mother mercifully removes the curtain over Maya you will see the Eternal play of Truth or the play of Nature and Spirit in as ‘Rasa Leela’. ',
'You sometimes find unnecessary grace so that the blind and false superstitions of religion are dispelled and you can believe in the true ideas of religion and the idea of grace. A day will come when this truth will manifest fully. Ignorance and darkness will disappear for ever. Sons! Do not feel disappointed and do not remain unbelievers any more.',
'Sons ! However wise and learned you may think yourselves to be, do not forget that the ‘key’ lies with the Guru. So it is  hardly surprising that the impossible becomes possible by the power of His grace.',
'Do not forget that grace is at the root of ‘Siddhi’. Prayers and offerings are mere pretexts. Renounce all your pride, think yourselves as humble as clay and hold fast to his feet. He is kinder than is necessary ! He shows mercy to people voluntarily. And he who asks for it – his fortune is boundless.',
'Since you are worldly men you will certainly be in trouble or impious situations sometimes. So a seasoned householder’s duty is to be prepared for all kinds of situations. No situation should make you depressed. You should be prepared like a brave warrior. Ramakrishnadeva used to say, ‘If the son holds the father’s hand,  while moving on a narrow path, the son may slip and fall, but if the father holds the son’s hand there is no possibility  for the son to fall.’ Son! I too am holding your hand. So where is the scope for disappointment ? But the weakness you sometimes experience is an inevitable result of your actions in your previous births. Actually you have nothing to fear.',
'Do not give up anything very easily. Give me an opportunity to keep you hand holding. In that case there won’t be any fear of falling.',
'Sons ! Depend on me and float on the ocean of joy without any fear or enxiety; though sometimes you may be caught up in a whirlpool, know it for certain that it will not be a permanent situation. One day I shall take you all to the Abode of Joy and there we shall all become embodiments of joy through pure love.',
'You should be eager for the joyous new union in a new form in a new world.  You should be absorbed in the thought of that new union. When the curtain of this world falls, the way to the world of joy will open. Do you understand? ',
'The Guru-disciple relationship is closer than can be thought of ; the true Guru and the true disciple are of one soul and have two different bodily forms. At the higher level Guru is the body and the disciple, only shadow. In this way, one day the body and the shadow will merge together.',
'Depend on the Guru and obey his orders. One day your hopes will be fulfilled. Twelve years’ period is nothing. If  necessary, you may have to wait for ages. But, one day you will certainly get what you want.',
'Even if my body becomes fragile, it will have enough strength to hold your hands firmly and drag you to the Eternal Abode. Enjoy this world freely as much as you can . But see that your faith remains intact.',
'Those who have fully surrendered themselves to their respective Gurus, those who have taken refuge with him and are performing their Gurus’ most desired tasks or are serving , their Gurus’ will attain the same final stage as their Gurus have  attained even if they are ignorant, even if they do not have conscience and self-denial or even if they are full of worldly desires.',
'Whatever I have always said, I repeat: Those who surrendered themselves as ‘mine’, must attain deliverance. Unless they are delivered I myself shall remain undelivered.',
'I know how living beings become immortal though death. I shall also attract  you one by one and take to the Abode of Joy . Again one day there will be a great joyous union of all.',
'Since living beings know nothing about what lies beyond death, they are afraid of death. Since it is certain that either today or tomorrow we must die, why should we be afraid of death ? Especially those who have taken shelter at the feet of the Sadguru will leave this painful world of affliction and sorrow after death and proceed to the peaceful and joyous abode along with the Guru. Death is the gateway to that kingdom! So one should not be afraid of death but find joy in it.',
'If Behari’s grandmother not being my disciple and yet at the hour of deaths sees me in a vision, what else is there to say about you ? Whether you believe or not, I shall perform my duty when it is time. I shall appear before you at the right place and at the right moment and guide you towards the destined path.',
'Why should diseases or afflictions weaken your spirits ? Why should you feel depressed ? Living beings are born on the earth to do penance for their past actions. You must unburden the load of this world here itself. Do not increase you load with death-wish. Dependence means all sorts of dependence. You must be able to bear joy and sorrow evenly. Let the player play at his instruments as he likes. Your duty is only ti listen. Dress up with the armour of patience, forbearance and seriousness and fight the war in the field of actions. If you are victorious you get this world and if you killed you will ascend to heaven. Do not forget this divine message of mine.',
'You are children of the Divine Spirit. Grief, pain and sorrow are contrary to your character. People lie on the mother’s lap and dream of things contrary to their character. When they wake up the dream can no more overwhelm them. You are my sweet little children. I started calling you up when it was still night. So, you woke up but fell asleep again. Soon the dark night will be over and the sun of wisdom will rise ; you will also wake up and the slumber will disappear for ever. The dawn will perhaps break son. That is why I hear the litful melody of birds in my heart’s bower.'];
