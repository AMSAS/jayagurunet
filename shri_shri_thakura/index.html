  papers. Around the time of his wife’s eternal departure, the lamp on the
  table he was working on slowly became dim and he saw Sudhansubala standing by
  the side of his table. Her complexion was radiant but her face was pale and
  gloomy and she did not say anything. He got frightened and screamed. The
  figure vanished leaving Nalinikanta disturbed over the event. He left for
  Kutabpur as soon as he got leave from service and heard the sad news from
  villagers on his way.<br/><br/>Nalinikanta
  found out the details of his wife’s last moments and her last words for him.

  wondering about the existence of the soul after death.<br/><br/>Nalinikanta

  the offerings. As time passed and Sudhansubala did not appear to take

  that moment, Sudhansubala appeared again in her astral form and asked him to

  still had a lot of unanswered questions.<br/><br/>Nalinikanta
  returned to his work at Kumira but kept an eye on any saints visiting Calcutta.
  Around November-December 1901, he heard about Swami Purnananda, an
  ex-professor who enjoyed a good deal of reputation. Nalinikanta finally got a

  lead him to his wife as well.<br/><br/>Back
  at Kumira, one night in the month of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Margasira</i>,

  and finally ended up in Kashi. Without any answer in sight, he became

  into Sannyasa and was named “Nigamananda” by his guru. He had mastered with ease
  the secrets of the knowledge of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Nigama</i>

  (Vedas). In order to realize the deeper spiritual import of four great
  sayings of Vedas, as a sannyasi, Swami Nigamananda had to undertake a
  pilgrimage to the four <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>dhams</i>.  <br/><br/>He
  was accompanied by Swami Sachchidananda to Badrinath and on the way they
  stopped at Gouri Maa’s ashram. She was a renowned female Yogic saint. During

  <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mahabakya</i> of Vedas, “<i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ayamatama Brahma</i>”. After returning
  from Badrinath, Shri Shri Thakur went to visit the remaining three <i

  the knowledge of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bramha</i> through “<i

  forests of Kota, he met two young women, who he later found out were yoginis.
  Per their direction, he left for <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Calcutta</st1:place></st1:City>.<br/><br/>Continuing
  his quest, around the month of May-June, Swami Nigamananda travelled eastward
  to Kamakshya and Parasuram Tirtha now in Arunachal Pradesh. At Parasuram
  Tirtha, he fell ill with fever and dysentery but recovered with the help of
  the tribal people in that area. One day while enjoying the natural beauty of
  the hills, he wandered into the jungle and was lost and decided to rest the night
  in the hollow of a big tree trunk. Towards dawn, he met a saint with a
  radiating glow below the tree. This was his Y<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

  three months, Swami Nigamananda read yogic scriptures and learnt and practiced
  methods of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Yoga Sadhana</i>.<br/><br/>Per

  commandment is:</b></span> I left Saraswata Matha and Ashrams, and have been living
  a solitary life at Puri for about 12 years. Here I was staying almost
  inactive for these years. Ultimately, all of you came and your number
  gradually increased. On seeing you after so many years I experience and feel
  a divine urge and inspiration inside. It is my desire that you should
  practise to live a life of order and discipline. Do not treat it as a child’s
  play. If you have taken shelter under me do it seriously in the best possible
  manner. See! I have given opportunity of doing Arati only to my household
  devotees. Sannyasis and Brahmacharis are not given this privilege. Before
  offering me Arati and worship, you should learn sincerely how to perform
  these correctly. If one wants to deliver a lecture or enact a role on the
  stage, he has to practice it first and then perform it in the real field. It
  is called rehearsal.<br/><br/>Each of you should set up the image of Shri Gurudev in
  your house and worship it according to the practices prevalent in your State.
  Chant the hymns in front of the image and try to understand their meaning. On
  a specific day in a week, all of you assemble in a place and offer Arati,
  prayers, read <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Aryadarpan</i> and other
  holy books. You should discuss together my teachings and ideas. At the end of
  each session, decide the place of next session ….<br/><br/><span style='font-size:12.5pt; font-family:Calibri'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Then my 2<sup>nd</sup>
  commandment is:</b></span>  Lead an ideal household life. My household devotees have attained more
  spiritual progress than others. They are more cautious about religion than
  those who have renounced the world.…. If you lead an ideal household life,
  your children will develop good moral character. Again, the great sages like,
  Vyasa, Vasistha, Jaimini and Patanjali will be born in your families.<br/><br/><span style='font-size:12.5pt; font-family:Calibri'><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>My 3<sup>rd</sup>

  commandment is:</b></span>  You should exchange your spiritual feelings among yourselves which is called
  ‘Bhava Binimaya’. Each guru-brother should not conceal anything from one
  another. Those who want to speak to me something secretly, I think, they have
  some selfish motive. They may either beg for wealth or pray to cure their
  disease. You should disclose everything before me innocently without a pinch
  of hypocrisy. You should observe simplicity and truthfulness… <br/><br/>Hope you will not forget whatever I have told you today”.<br/><br/>
